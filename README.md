# Austin Risk Grid

Austin traffic response is reactive. Units move after an incident is reported, often arriving after congestion has formed.

Austin Risk Grid is a decision support tool that predicts where incidents are most likely in the next hour and recommends where to stage response assets proactively.

## What it produces
1. A next hour risk map of Austin
2. A ranked list of staging locations with short reasons
3. Optional weather adjusted recommendations

## Data sources
1. City of Austin Open Data, Real Time Traffic Incident Reports
2. Optional NOAA weather

## One sentence pitch
Learn Austin incident rhythm by location and time, forecast next hour risk, and recommend staging locations before incidents stack up.
